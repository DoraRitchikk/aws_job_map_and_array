# aws_job_map_and_array
1)Job with explode function - bad practice,because that method make our dataframe bigger (increase number of rows)

2)Job without explode file - using flatten and transform functions 

3)Job with language filed - created schema with ArrayType, got values and transform to new column - top 10 min values from each id
